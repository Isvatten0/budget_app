## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Supabase account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd budget-planner-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Copy your project URL and anon key

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

5. **Set up the database**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `database-schema.sql`
   - Run the SQL to create all tables and policies

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üìä Database Schema

The app uses the following main tables:

- `users` - User profiles and authentication
- `user_settings` - Pay frequency, theme preferences, etc.
- `bank_balances` - Historical bank balance records
- `recurring_income` - Regular income sources
- `recurring_expenses` - Regular bills and expenses
- `goals` - Savings goals and targets
- `transactions` - One-time income and expenses

## üéØ How It Works

### Bank Balance Based Budgeting
Unlike traditional zero-based budgeting, this app focuses on your actual bank balance:

1. **Input Current Balance** - Start with your real bank balance
2. **Set Pay Schedule** - Tell the app when you get paid
3. **Add Recurring Items** - Income sources and regular bills
4. **Smart Forecasting** - App calculates:
   - What you should have in the bank
   - How much is reserved for upcoming bills
   - How much is discretionary to spend
   - Whether you're on track for goals

### Pay Cycle Planning
The app uses your pay frequency to:
- Calculate budget cycles
- Reserve funds for bills beyond the current pay period
- Provide recommendations for early savings
- Prevent surprise shortfalls
